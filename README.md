# NHANESanalysis2025
All this data came from the the NHANES built-in plugin in CODAP, getting data for all the people the plugin has information on for 2017 to 2020, excluding the systolic bloood pressure variable (which seems to crash the plugin). There are around 10,000 people in total. For more details, see:
